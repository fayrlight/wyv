README
======

Wyv turns HQEMU, an enhancement of QEMU built upon LLVM optimizations into
a Dynamic Binary Translating Instruction Set Randomizer meant to provide
elevated security for userland processes.

It is still in development stage, but is meant to eventually be added to
Linux binfmt and run any executable including web browsers.

You can use it like "wyv /usr/bin/test"
